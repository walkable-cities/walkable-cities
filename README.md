# Walkable Cities 
## What
We want to build a web-app which allows visualisation via maps and graphs of crucial data about how walk-friendly is an area. There are certain factors encouraging people to choose to walk or to cycle instead of driving. The most important ones are: 
- short distance to essential shops and services
- connectivity (density of a street grid)
- compactness (density of build up spaces)
- enclosure (buildings along the street) 
- green spaces and trees
- width of a street
- services on the ground floor. 

We want to present this data in a simple and esthetic way using Open Street Map (OSM) as the main data source. Our aim is to give a tool for better and faster analysis of an area and with this knowledge help to create better communities.

## Why
The structure of our cities determines our dependency on a car. The more we walk and cycle the more the place is livable, sustainable, safe and we are healthier. However, walk-friendly communities usually have higher rent and living prices because they are in high demand. That can exclude the part of our society which can not afford to pay higher prices from having a good quality living space. 
In our project we want to give a tool for citizens, city planners, decision makers and the private sector to find and understand problems and potentials in a given area. We want to raise awareness of what contributes to better living in cities and help to create communities where people want to live and also where they can afford to live. The data presented in a simple way empowers the citizens to be an equal partner in a dialogue about the development in cities. It can also make the planning process more efficient, fair and transparent. 

Letâ€™s give an example.
One of the data points we want to visualise is a 5 min distance to essential shops and services. On a map we show which areas have no access within a given time to a certain place. That can give incentives for the private and public sector to plan the lacking services in these areas.
